# Hi there.
You can check my R basics website [here](https://dallasferraz.github.io/docs/index.html)

You can also take a look at [my other repositories](https://github.com/dallasferraz) I've uploaded.

Cheers from Brazil to [Dr. Florian Privé](https://github.com/privefl/) for developing such an amazing R-to-github framework tutorial.
