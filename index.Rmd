Hello.

This page will help me keep track of my work with R and data science.

I want to give a shout-out to [Dr. Florian Priv√©](https://crumplab.github.io/LabJournalWebsite/index.html) for developing such an amazing R-to-github framework tutorial from which this website is mainly based on. Cheers from Brazil!
